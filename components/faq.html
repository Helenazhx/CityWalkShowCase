    <div class="faq-question">Why is the video download so large?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">To deliver the most immersive and high-quality experience possible on Apple Vision Pro, we use 3D stereoscopic video at 8K resolution. This ensures incredible visual fidelity but requires significant data. We've optimized the videos as much as possible without compromising quality.</div>
